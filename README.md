# Sandbox
A repository for small experiments and exploratory ideas.

I use this repository as an 'incubator' for my experiments on topic areas in data science that interest me. Each folder contains a small project which typically consists of just a few scripts. As I'm a data scientist, most of the projects will be centered around data modeling techniques or a particular way to analyize/visualize a particular data set. 

If any of the projects grows to a more substantial size, I will move it out to its own repository.
